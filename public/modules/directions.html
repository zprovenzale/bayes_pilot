<h2>Reasoning Study</h2>

<p>
<strong>Instructions</strong><br>
For this experiment you will be shown a visualization and a text description of a reasoning problem. At the bottom of the page will be a button labeled "I'm ready to see the question". Please take as much time as you want to understand the visualization and text. When you are ready to answer a few questions based on the information presented, please click the "I'm ready to see the question" button. <br><br>

The visualization and text will remain on the page with the questions and a word selection task will appear.
It consists of a scrolling list of words moving at a certain speed. Your task will be to select as many <b>fruits</b> as possible in the list of words while answering the questions. <b> Your priority should be to answer the questions correctly </b>. If you answer <b>both</b> questions correctly, you will be awarded a bonus of $0.5. If you miss more than 50% of the fruit words or misidentify more than 50% of the words, $0.25 will be deducted from your bonus.
